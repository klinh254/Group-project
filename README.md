# Group project: CTF Playground

The project aims to offer some simple and basic CTF challenges.

To deploy these challenges, we also implement a website platform. It it designed to display, provide environments for the challenges, and check for the answer of users. It also contains a scoring mechanism and leaderboard. The system is built in an isolated environment by Docker to ensure a safe experience with the challenges.
